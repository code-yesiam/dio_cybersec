# Phishing model with Kali Linux to capture email and passwords from Facebook login

This project was made with Dio, who had created a cybersec training with Cassiano Peres. A great instructor, by the way.

But well, how do we start?

## Prerequisites

- First, you'll need to have [Virtual Box](https://virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Make all installation steps.
- Install [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/). Use the Installer Images for this tutorial.
- Extract your Kali archive
- Create a VM into VirtualBox using your Kali image

And that's it. If you're confused until here, you can go to [Dio Cybersec Course](https://dio.me) to understand better.

##Tutorial

- After installing all those things on your Kali VM, open his prompt command;
- Use ```sudo su``` to access your root;
- Start the ```setoolkit```, the tool that you will use for the project;
- Maybe you'll see something like this:
